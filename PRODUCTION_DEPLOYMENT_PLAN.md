# CargoParts Production Deployment Plan

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive deployment plan outlines the transition of CargoParts from MVP to production-ready deployment. The application is a Next.js 15 multi-tenant marketplace for auto parts in Saudi Arabia, featuring authentication, inventory management, order processing, and payment integration.

**Current Architecture Assessment:**
- **Architectural Impact**: HIGH
- **Pattern Compliance**: GOOD (follows Next.js App Router patterns, proper service layer separation)
- **SOLID Compliance**: MODERATE (needs improvement in dependency injection and interface segregation)
- **Security Posture**: BASIC (JWT auth implemented, needs hardening)
- **Scalability Readiness**: MODERATE (database schema well-designed, needs caching layer)

  rateLimitMiddleware(),
  authenticationMiddleware(),
  authorizationMiddleware(),
  validationMiddleware(),
  auditLogMiddleware()
]
```

## 3. Performance & Scalability

### 3.1 Database Optimization

**Critical Indexes Missing:**
```sql
-- Add composite indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_listings_search ON listings(status, is_active, city, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_seller_status ON orders(seller_id, status, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_cleanup ON sessions(expires_at) WHERE expires_at < NOW();

-- Partitioning for large tables
ALTER TABLE activity_logs PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);
ALTER TABLE order_status_history PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);
```

### 3.2 Caching Strategy

```yaml
Redis Cache Layers:
  L1 - Session Cache:
    - User sessions: 24 hours
    - Auth tokens: 7 days
  
  L2 - Application Cache:
    - Seller profiles: 1 hour
    - Product listings: 15 minutes
    - Search results: 5 minutes
  
  L3 - Database Query Cache:
    - Expensive queries: 30 minutes
    - Aggregations: 1 hour
```

### 3.3 Image Optimization

```typescript
// Next.js image optimization config
const imageConfig = {
  domains: ['cdn.cargoparts.sa'],
  deviceSizes: [320, 640, 750, 1080, 1200],
  imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96],
  formats: ['image/webp', 'image/avif'],
  minimumCacheTTL: 31536000,
}

// CloudFront image processing
- Automatic WebP conversion
- Lazy loading implementation
- Progressive image loading
```

### 3.4 API Performance

```yaml
Optimizations Required:
  - GraphQL implementation for complex queries
  - Database connection pooling (min: 10, max: 100)
  - Query result pagination (default: 20, max: 100)
  - Elasticsearch for product search
