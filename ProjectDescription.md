FILE: docs/OVERVIEW.md

Product Overview (Cargo Parts)

Cargo Parts connects individual car owners with scrapyards (ØªØ´Ù„ÙŠØ­) to buy used OEM parts online, with delivery across KSA. POC validates: search accuracy, seller onboarding, and endâ€‘toâ€‘end checkout.

Users
â€¢	Buyer: AR-first, mobile-heavy, wants fitment confidence, price transparency, delivery.
â€¢	Seller (Yard): fast listing flow, photo upload, simple pricing, order notifications.

Key Flows (POC)
1.	VIN decode â†’ search â†’ results â†’ detail â†’ cart â†’ checkout â†’ payment â†’ tracking.
2.	Seller creates listing with photos â†’ instantly searchable.

Non-goals (POC)
â€¢	RFQ/Request-a-Part marketplace (phase 2)
â€¢	Advanced logistics (freight orchestration)
â€¢	Complex dispute/warranty center (basic policy only)

Architecture (POC â†’ Scale)

UI components via shadcn/ui (built on Radix).

UI components via shadcn/ui (built on Radix).

UI components via shadcn/ui (built on Radix).

Runtime
â€¢	Next.js (App Router) with a BFF pattern using Route Handlers and Server Actions.
â€¢	Start as a modular monolith; isolate modules (auth, catalog, orders, payments, shipping) for future extraction.

Data Layer
â€¢	PostgreSQL via Prisma (schema in prisma/schema.prisma).
â€¢	Storage (Supabase/S3) with signed URLs for images.
â€¢	Search: Postgres FTS + trigram (Elastic later).
â€¢	Cache/Queues: Redis (optional in POC; required when adding chat/notifications).

Key Services (as modules)
â€¢	auth â€” email OTP; JWT session cookie; RBAC.
â€¢	catalog â€” listings, OEM number, make/model/year fitment ranges.
â€¢	search â€” text ranking + year overlap compatibility bonus.
â€¢	orders â€” carts, orders, state machine, totals.
â€¢	payments â€” intents + webhooks (idempotent).
â€¢	shipping â€” mock rates; real labels later.
â€¢	admin â€” verify sellers, moderate listings.

API Contracts (selected)
â€¢	POST /api/vin/decode â†’ mock decode
â€¢	GET /api/search â†’ results {items,total}
â€¢	POST /api/listings (seller)
â€¢	POST /api/orders â†’ create order, totals
â€¢	POST /api/payments/intent â†’ client secret / redirect
â€¢	POST /api/payments/webhook â†’ verify HMAC â†’ mark PAID

Observability & Security
â€¢	Request ID per API call; structured logs (pino).
â€¢	Error boundaries; centralized error util mapping to AR/EN messages.
â€¢	Rate limits on OTP/search; CSRF safe (API only + same-site cookies).
â€¢	Secrets in .env (use Vercel + Supabase secrets in prod).

FILE: docs/NEXTJS_PRO_RULES.md

Rules for Professional Next.js Applications (Team Playbook)

0) UI Kit
   â€¢	Use shadcn/ui for base primitives (Button, Input, Card, Dialog, Sheet, Dropdown). Extend via wrappers in components/ui/ with AR/EN props and RTL awareness.

1) Architecture & Code Organization
   â€¢	App Router only; colocate UI, data fetching, and loading/error states per route segment.
   â€¢	Server-first: Prefer Server Components, Server Actions, and Route Handlers. Keep client components minimal and opt-in.
   â€¢	Feature folders: components/features/<feature> and lib/<domain>; no mega utils.
   â€¢	Explicit boundaries: Modules (auth, catalog, orders, payments) expose typed service functions.

2) Type Safety & Validation
   â€¢	End-to-end types with TypeScript (no any).
   â€¢	Zod for runtime validation on all inputs (API, server actions, env).
   â€¢	env.mjs pattern: parse process.env with Zod at boot; crash fast if invalid.

3) Data Fetching & Caching
   â€¢	Use fetch with cache semantics or Server Actions. Choose a strategy per route:
   â€¢	Static (force-cache) for marketing pages.
   â€¢	Revalidate with revalidate: <seconds> for catalogs.
   â€¢	No-store for personalized data (cart, dashboard).
   â€¢	Memoize expensive server functions; avoid N+1 with batch queries.

4) Performance
   â€¢	Ship less JS: client components only for interactivity.
   â€¢	Code-splitting by route; lazy-load modals/forms.
   â€¢	Image optimization (next/image), responsive sizes.
   â€¢	DB: proper indexes; use SELECT columns (no *).

5) i18n & RTL
   â€¢	next-intl with AR default; English fallback.
   â€¢	Use logical CSS props (ps-, pe-, ms-, me-).
   â€¢	Localize currency/number/date; SAR by default; Eastern numerals toggle.

6) Security
   â€¢	Auth cookies: HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax/Strict, Secure in prod.
   â€¢	Authorization: server-side guards per action; no role checks only in client.
   â€¢	File uploads: signed URLs; verify mime/size; scan if needed.
   â€¢	Webhooks: HMAC verification; idempotency keys.
   â€¢	Rate limits for OTP, login, search, payments.

7) Errors & Reliability
   â€¢	Use Route Segment Error Boundaries. Never leak stack traces to users.
   â€¢	Standard error format { code, message, details? } (localized message at edge).
   â€¢	Background jobs retried with backoff; dedupe by key.

8) Testing
   â€¢	Unit: business logic and Zod schemas.
   â€¢	Integration: API route handlers with a test DB.
   â€¢	E2E: Playwright happy path (VINâ†’checkout).
   â€¢	PRs require green typecheck + lint + tests.

9) DX & CI/CD
   â€¢	Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, chore: â€¦) + Changesets for versioning.
   â€¢	GitHub Actions: typecheck, lint, test, build; deploy preview on PR.
   â€¢	Keep .env.example current; secrets in CI as masked vars.

10) Accessibility & UX
    â€¢	All interactive controls keyboard reachable; focus ring visible.
    â€¢	Color contrast >= WCAG AA; RTL-friendly layouts.
    â€¢	Forms with labels, ARIA where needed; error summaries.

11) Observability
    â€¢	Structured logs with request IDs.
    â€¢	Frontend error tracking (Sentry) + backend (Sentry/OTel).
    â€¢	Health endpoint and simple readiness checks.

12) Code Review Checklist (Quick)
    â€¢	Domain logic on server? âœ…
    â€¢	Inputs zod-validated? âœ…
    â€¢	i18n strings & RTL-safe? âœ…
    â€¢	Caching chosen explicitly? âœ…
    â€¢	Error states covered? âœ…
    â€¢	Tests updated? âœ…

FILE: docs/SECURITY.md

Security Practices
â€¢	Store secrets outside the repo; rotate regularly.
â€¢	Enforce 2FA on GitHub and deployments.
â€¢	Validate all webhooks (HMAC); log signature failures.
â€¢	File uploads: size limit, MIME allowlist, strip EXIF.
â€¢	Payments: use hosted fields/SDK from gateway; never store card data.
â€¢	PII: minimal collection, encrypt at rest if stored server-side.

FILE: docs/DECISIONS.md (ADRs)
â€¢	ADR-001: App Router over Pages Router â€” better colocation & server-first patterns.
â€¢	ADR-002: Prisma over TypeORM â€” DX speed for POC; migrate later if needed.
â€¢	ADR-003: Postgres FTS + trigram for POC search â€” migrate to Elastic when >200k listings.
â€¢	ADR-004: Email OTP first â€” lower friction; SMS later for KSA numbers.
â€¢	ADR-005: Supabase Storage with signed URLs â€” simplest start, S3 parity later.

FILE: docs/TEAM_ONBOARDING.md

Setup in Claude Code / local
1.	Duplicate .env.example â†’ .env and fill values.
2.	pnpm i â†’ pnpm prisma db push â†’ pnpm dev.
3.	Use AR as default locale; test English toggle.
4.	Create a seller from seed or via /seller dashboard â†’ post first listing.

Dev Conventions
â€¢	One feature per PR. Keep routes and server actions close to UI.
â€¢	Translate strings as you code; donâ€™t leave TODO i18n.
â€¢	Prefer server utilities over client fetches.

FILE: docs/NEXT_STEPS.md
â€¢	Generate Prisma schema & seed
â€¢	Stub API route handlers (VIN, search, listings, orders, payments)
â€¢	Scaffolding UI pages with placeholders
â€¢	Add Playwright e2e for the happy path
