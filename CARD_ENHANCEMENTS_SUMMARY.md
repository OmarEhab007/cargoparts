- **Spacing**: Consistent 8px grid system throughout
- **Colors**: Proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- **Shadows**: Layered shadow system for depth perception

### 3. Interactive Feedback
- **Hover States**: Smooth scale and lift animations

- **Loading States**: Shimmer effects and progressive disclosure
- **Active States**: Tactile press feedback

### 4. Accessibility
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic markup
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible

### 5. Responsiveness
- **Mobile-First**: Cards adapt to different screen sizes
- **Touch-Friendly**: Appropriate touch targets (44px minimum)
- **Performance**: Optimized animations and transitions
- **RTL Support**: Proper Arabic layout support

## Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Card
```jsx
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from '@/components/ui/card';

<Card className="card-glow-saudi">
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Enhanced Card Title</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    Your content here
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### Dashboard Metric Card
```jsx
import { SaudiMetricCard } from '@/components/ui/saudi-theme';

<SaudiMetricCard
  title="Total Revenue"
  value="45,280 SAR"
  change={12.5}
  icon={DollarSign}
  variant="revenue"
  showProgress
  progressValue={84}
/>
```

### Premium Product Card
```jsx
import { ProductCard } from '@/components/ui/card-variants';

<ProductCard className="card-premium">
  {/* Product content */}
</ProductCard>
```

## Performance Considerations

### Saudi Market Alignment
