## Tech Stack Status

### ✅ Already Configured
- Next.js 15.4.6 with App Router
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui components (40+ components ready)
- Prisma with PostgreSQL schema
- Docker Compose for database
- React Hook Form + Zod

### ✅ Installed
- next-intl for i18n ✅
- sonner for notifications ✅

### ⚠️ Needs Installation (For Production)
- jsonwebtoken for JWT
- nodemailer for email OTP
- @aws-sdk/client-s3 or @supabase/supabase-js for storage
- Payment gateway SDKs

## Database Schema Status
✅ Complete schema defined in `prisma/schema.prisma` with:
- User, Seller, Listing, Photo models
- Order, OrderItem, Payment models
- Proper enums and relationships

## Critical Path Items
1. Environment configuration (blocks everything)
2. Database connection (blocks all data operations)
3. i18n setup (affects all UI development)
4. Authentication (blocks user-specific features)
5. Basic routing structure (foundation for all pages)

## Development Guidelines
- Server-first approach (minimize client components)
- Arabic as default locale
- Use logical CSS properties for RTL support
- Maintain end-to-end type safety
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow security best practices (HttpOnly cookies, HMAC verification, rate limiting)

## Completed POC Features
✅ Phase 1: Foundation - Complete
✅ Phase 3: Core Marketplace Features - Complete
✅ Phase 6: User Interfaces - Complete
✅ Search & Filtering - Advanced search with multiple filters
✅ Shopping Cart - Persistent cart with quick add functionality
✅ Order Management - Buyer and seller order interfaces
✅ Bilingual Support - Arabic/English with RTL
