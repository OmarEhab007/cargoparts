# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* **Being respectful**: Using welcoming and inclusive language
* **Being collaborative**: Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* **Focusing on what is best for the community**: Showing empathy towards other community members
* **Being supportive**: Helping newcomers and those asking questions
* **Cultural sensitivity**: Respecting the Saudi Arabian context and Islamic values of our community
* **Language inclusivity**: Supporting both Arabic and English communication

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Disrespectful comments about cultural, religious, or regional practices
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Cultural Considerations

Given that Cargo Parts serves the Saudi Arabian market, we ask all contributors to be mindful of:

* **Islamic values**: Respecting Islamic principles in discussions and contributions
* **Cultural sensitivity**: Understanding and respecting Saudi Arabian business culture
* **Language support**: Supporting Arabic-first design and bilingual functionality
* **Regional practices**: Considering local business practices and regulations
* **Time zones**: Being mindful of contributors across different time zones, particularly Gulf Standard Time (GST)

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Language and Communication

* **Primary Languages**: Arabic and English are both welcome and encouraged
* **Respectful Communication**: All communication should be professional and respectful
* **Clear Documentation**: Contributions should include clear documentation in English, with Arabic translations when possible
* **Inclusive Terminology**: Use inclusive language that welcomes developers from all backgrounds
